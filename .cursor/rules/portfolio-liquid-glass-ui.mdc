# Portfolio Liquid Glass UI

Objective: Provide tokens and patterns for Apple-like Liquid Glass (iOS/macOS) with animated gradients and performance/accessibility safeguards.

## Tokens
- `--glass-bg`: rgba(255,255,255,0.15)
- `--glass-border`: rgba(255,255,255,0.20–0.30)
- `--glass-blur`: 16px
- `--glass-shadow`: 0 8px 32px 0 rgba(31,38,135,0.20)
- Gradient base: conic or radial with blues/purples/pinks; duration 6–12s; easing cubic-bezier(.65,0,.35,1)

## Patterns
- Sticky navbar: semi-transparent dark alpha (~0.72), backdrop-blur, subtle border, light shadow.
- Animated underline (Framer Motion): spring transition; `useReducedMotion` fallback.
- Section tracking: IntersectionObserver thresholds mobile 0.5 / desktop 0.6–0.7; rootMargin bias.
- Reduced motion: disable gradient movement and underline animation.
- Contrast: provide `prefers-contrast: more` overrides; ensure legible text.
- Fallback: `@supports not (backdrop-filter)` set solid backgrounds/borders.

## Performance
- Limit blur areas to small fixed containers (nav/cards).
- Cap DPR on low-spec; disable postprocessing and heavy effects.
- Defer heavy client components; keep bundle budgets in check.
